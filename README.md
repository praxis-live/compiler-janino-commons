Janino commons javac API
========================

This is a repackaged version of the [Janino](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JANINO/Home) compiler interface for the
javax.tools interface adapted to work with the refactored javac (v7) compiler at
https://github.com/praxis-live/compiler-javac7

This code is refactored to allow Janino to compile and run Java code fragments on the fly using the full OpenJDK 7
compiler without requiring, or conflicting with, an installed JDK.
